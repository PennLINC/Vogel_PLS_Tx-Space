Code documentation
!!!!!
This section is the bulk of the project page, and can be broken up as best fits the project. Remember that this should be acessible prose that allows your replicator, reviewer, or interested reader to step through your code and understand how the code corresponds to the findings described in the paper. At a minimum, there should be clear documentation regarding sample selection (e.g., inclusion/exclusion), preprocessing (e.g., container version, data freeze), and hypothesis testing (usually in the form of an analytic notebook). See the Project Reproducibility Guide for more information.
